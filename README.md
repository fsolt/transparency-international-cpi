[Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/)'s Corruption Perceptions Index provides information about the level of corruption perceived to exist in countries around the world on scale from 0 (most perceived corruption) to 100 (least perceived corruption).  Data from 2012 [are available](https://images.transparencycdn.org/images/CPI2023_Global_Results__Trends.xlsx) in a fairly convenient format from TI, but earlier years---the CPI was first released in 1995---are provided only one at a time and are scaled differently, from 0 to 10, making analyses drawing on all of the data difficult.  The R script here collects and cleans the available CPI scores and their standard errors from the TI website, puts them all on the 0 to 100 scale, and joins them in a single csv file convenient for analysis.
